              yes — reasonable, given it asked to open the most private thing on their
              phone before showing anything. Accepting already fetches the echo for the
              entry they just wrote (acceptConsent -> fetchEcho), so the value arrives
              in the same tap; the copy just never said so.

              stay informed — a vague "see what happens" that quietly ships someone's
              journal would be a dark pattern, and privacy is the whole product. */}
